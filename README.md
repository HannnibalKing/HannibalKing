# 👋 Hey there, I'm HannibalKing

I'm a former Army technician with 14 years of service, including combat missions and command & control operations with Special Forces and Rangers. I’ve rebuilt helicopters from the ground up—avionics, electrical systems, and mission-critical communications. I’ve flown in enemy territory, coordinated UAV video feeds across multiple assets, and overseen infantry and artillery divisions. Precision and discipline aren’t just buzzwords—they’re how I operate.

After transitioning out of the military, I dove headfirst into tech. I started with Lua scripting for embedded systems, built LAMP stack apps, and now specialize in full-stack development using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js). I’ve built media servers, Dockerized environments, and high-performance water-cooled machines from scratch. I’ve coded with Arduino for 3D printers, developed Android apps in Java and Rust, and integrated AI into my workflows to push my coding further.

I’m a Linux enthusiast (Debian since the early days), a relentless learner, and a Cornell Business Essentials graduate—bringing strategic thinking and execution to every project I touch.

Life threw me a curveball with a severe injury that wrecked my nervous system and mobility. But I didn’t quit. I wrote a book about my disease, rebuilt my mind and body, and now live by the Japanese philosophy of *kintsugi*—mending what’s broken to make it stronger. I’m disabled, but I’m not done for.

I’ve tracked supercars like the Ferrari F8 Tributo and KTM X-Bow, fed hungry children in the Middle East, donated to churches, and built things that matter. I wear a lot of hats—and I wear them with purpose.
