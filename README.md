# ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to My GitHub

I'm a former Army technician with 14 years of service, including combat missions and command & control operations with Special Forces and Rangers. I rebuilt helicopters from scratchâ€”avionics and electrical systemsâ€”and oversaw infantry and artillery divisions using advanced UAV video sharing and multi-asset coordination.

My tech journey began with Lua scripting for radios, evolved through LAMP stack development (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP), and now centers on full-stack MERN applications (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js). Iâ€™ve built media servers, Dockerized environments, and high-performance water-cooled systems from the ground up.

Iâ€™ve coded with Arduino for 3D printers, developed Android apps in Java and Rust, and integrated AI into my development workflows. Iâ€™m a Linux enthusiast (Debian since its early days), and Iâ€™ve built full-stack apps for personal and professional use.

After surviving a life-threatening injury that damaged my nervous system and mobility, I refused to quit. I wrote a book about my disease and live by the Japanese philosophy of *kintsugi*â€”mending whatâ€™s broken to become stronger. Iâ€™m disabled, but not done for.

Iâ€™ve tracked supercars like the Ferrari F8 Tributo and KTM X-Bow, donated to churches, fed hungry children in the Middle East, and lived as an adventurer with a purpose. I wear many hatsâ€”and I wear them with discipline, humility, and precision.
